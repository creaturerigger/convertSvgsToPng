# convertSvgsToPng
A simple code block to set path's fill color to white (#FFFFFF) in a SVG file.
In case of use the directories in the code has to be changed correspondingly.
I needed an icon set for a non-commercial .NET project, that's why
I wrote this code block. The dependencies are lxml and cairosvg.
